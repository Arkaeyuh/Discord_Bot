### **College Hotline**

A discord bot that is currently in the works created for my friend group's server titled College Hotline

### **APIs**

Currently using DSharpPlus and Newtonsoft, more may be added soon

### **Setup**

Download all the files, and update the config.json to include your own bot token in place of the "token" in the file. 
Then you can run Program.cs and the bot should be running.
