### **College Hotline**

A discord bot that is currently in the works created for my friend group's server titled College Hotline

### **APIs**

DSharpPlus for Discord API, Newtonsoft as a JsonReader, and Lavalink 3 for music capabilities

### **Setup**

Download all the files, and update the config.json to include your own bot token in place of the "token" in the file. 
Add in your own server, port, and password in the config from Lavalink 3, which can be found here https://github.com/lavalink-devs/Lavalink/releases
Follow the docs on the lavalink github page and make sure you have a application.yml congifured in the same directory.
Then you can run Program.cs and the bot should be running.
